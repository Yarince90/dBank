#dBank

This is a DeFI DApp I made while learning to use Web3 blockchain technologies, it uses IC (Internet Computer) written in Motoko from Dfinity and JavaScript.

It starts off with $100 and allows thr user to add or subtract from that, every time the "Finalise Transaction" button is pressed it updates the new amount including the interest earned on what the balance was before the transaction at a rate of 1% per second ...something we can only dream of :).
